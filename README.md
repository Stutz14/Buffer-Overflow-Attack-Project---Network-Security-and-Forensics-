# Buffer-Overflow-Attack-Project---Network-Security-and-Forensics-
Project Overview:
This project focuses on researching, reproducing, and demonstrating a buffer overflow attack, a critical vulnerability that occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold. This vulnerability can overwrite adjacent memory locations, such as the return address in the stack, leading to unexpected behavior or even allowing arbitrary code execution. Through this demonstration, we aim to showcase the risks associated with buffer overflow vulnerabilities and emphasize the importance of secure coding practices.

Technical Demonstration:
The project involves two systems:

Vulnerable Server: Simulates a poorly coded application with a buffer overflow vulnerability. This server accepts user input over the network but lacks proper memory management.
Attackerâ€™s Machine: Used to craft malicious inputs that overflow the buffer, overwriting critical memory locations, including the return address, and ultimately allowing arbitrary code execution.
Key Objectives:

Highlight the security risks of buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
Demonstrate the potential impacts, such as memory corruption, application crashes, and reverse shell execution.
Emphasize the need for countermeasures, including secure coding practices and memory management techniques.
Deliverables:

Video Presentation (15 minutes):
General educational overview of buffer overflow attacks and their consequences (2 minutes).
Technical breakdown of the vulnerability and countermeasures (3-5 minutes).
Demonstration of the exploit, showing its impact and how it works (8-10 minutes).
Detailed Report (8-10 pages):
Introduction to the vulnerability and its impact.
Technical overview of how buffer overflow attacks work and why they occur.
Countermeasures to mitigate such risks.
Step-by-step methodology for performing the attack, supported by screenshots and descriptions.
This project is an opportunity to enhance our understanding of offensive security techniques while maintaining ethical standards and compliance with legal boundaries.
